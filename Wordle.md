## Game Description

**Wordle** is a web-based word puzzle game designed to test and enhance your vocabulary and problem-solving skills. The objective is to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

### Background

I chose to create Wordle because it offers a simple yet challenging gameplay experience that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It also provides an excellent opportunity to practice and demonstrate web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. Enter a five-letter word in the input field.
2. Press the "Submit" button to make your guess.
3. The tiles will change color to indicate the accuracy of your guess:
   - **Green**: Correct letter in the correct position.
   - **Yellow**: Correct letter in the wrong position.
   - **Gray**: Incorrect letter.
4. Repeat the process until you guess the correct word or run out of attempts.
